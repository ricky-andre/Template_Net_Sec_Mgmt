# Template_Net_Sec_Mgmt
A script to manage an inventory of devices, each of them with a profile. Configurations are checked against templates.

Just read the attached doc file here.

The module to connect to the target devices through a proxy or directly is outside the scope of this open source project, but you can find something to start with in another repository.

Some more explanations have been directly inserted into the example excel files.
